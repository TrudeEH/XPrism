TruDE is an open source desktop environment for Linux, designed to be extremely lightweight and customizable.
Instead of floating windows, TruDE tiles windows automatically. 
This allows for the DE to be operated exclusively with a keyboard.
TruDE supports any device capable of running Linux, including arm and 32bit processors. This makes it great for servers, that may have limited resources for the OS.
